Bindings to [MPFR](https://www.mpfr.org/) - "The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding".

Only unix operating systems with libmpfr installed as a system library is currently supported, ie no binaries for now. I have spent far too long compiling c libraries recently, sorry!
